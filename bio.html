Balasubrahmanyam and his wife being congratulated by K. J. Yesudas and his wife
Balasubrahmanyam debuted as a playback singer on 15 December 1966 with the song "Emiyee Vinta Moham" for Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna, a Telugu film scored by his mentor, S. P. Kodandapani. The first non-Telugu song that he recorded was in Kannada in 1966 for the film Nakkare Ade Swarga, starring T. R. Narasimharaju. He recorded his first Tamil song "Athaanodu Ippadi Irundhu Eththanai Naalaachu", a duet with L. R. Eswari under the musical direction of M. S. Viswanathan for the film Hotel Ramba, which never released. The song "Medante Meda Kaadu" from the film Sukha Dukhalu (1968) composed by Kondandapani brought him recognition in Telugu cinema.

Other early songs he sang were duets with P. Susheela, "Iyarkai Ennum Ilaya Kanni" in the 1969 film Shanti Nilayam, starring Gemini Ganesan, and "Aayiram Nilavae Vaa" for M. G. Ramachandran in Adimaippenn. His first song with S. Janaki was "Pournami Nilavil Pani Vizhum Iravil" in Kanni Penn. He was then introduced to the Malayalam film industry by G. Devarajan in the film Kadalppalam. As per Balasubrahmanyam, "Ye Divilo Virisina Parijathamo" from the 1973 Telugu film Kannevayasu composed by Satyam gave an amazing turning point to his singing career. 

Balasubrahmanyam recorded the most songs on a single day by any singer.He had recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra Kumar in Bangalore from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm on 8 February 1981 and 19 songs in Tamil, 16 songs in Hindi in a day.[50] In his words, "There were days when I used to record 15–20 songs, but only for Anand Milind. And I would take the last flight back to Chennai." In the 1970s, he also worked with M. S. Viswanathan in Tamil movies for actors such as M. G. Ramachandran, Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan. He recorded duets with P. Susheela, S. Janaki, Vani Jayaram and L. R. Eswari. Balasubrahmanyam's association with Ilaiyaraaja began even before Ilaiyaraaja came to the cine field. In the early days, he used to sing in towns and villages all over south India and Ilaiyaraaja, then an unknown harmonium and guitar player accompanied him in his concerts.

1980s
Balasubrahmanyam gained international recognition with the 1980 film Sankarabharanam. The film is considered to be one of the best films ever to emerge from the Telugu film industry. Directed by K. Viswanath, the film's soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan and led to an increase in the usage of Carnatic music in Telugu cinema as well as in other languages. Not a classically trained singer, he used a "film music" aesthetic in recording the songs. Balasubrahmanyam received his first National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for his work. His first work in Hindi films was in the following year, in Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981),for which he received another National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer.

Balasubrahmanyam began to record more songs in Telugu and other South Indian languages, especially for Ilaiyaraaja with S. Janaki, the trio considered to be highly successful in the Tamil film industry from the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. The songs were based on classical music, such as in Saagara Sangamam (1983) and Rudraveena (1988), for which Ilaiyaraaja and Balasubrahmanyam won National Awards for Best Music Director and Best Male Playback Singer respectively. South Indian actor Chiranjeevi said that SPB's voice is one of the main reasons for his success.

In 1989, Balasubrahmanyam was the playback singer for actor Salman Khan in Maine Pyar Kiya. The soundtrack for the film won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song Dil Deewana. For much of the next decade, Balasubrahmanyam continued as the "romantic singing voice" on the soundtracks of Khan's films. Notable among these was Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! which became the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time. Balasubrahmanyam's duet with Lata Mangeshkar, "Didi Tera Devar Deewana", was very popular. SP Balasubrahmanyam became identified as Salman Khan's voice in the 90s just like Kishore Kumar became Rajesh Khanna's voice through the 70s.

1990s

In the 1990s, he worked with composers such as Vidyasagar, M. M. Keeravani, Hamsalekha, S. A. Rajkumar and Deva among others, but his association with A. R. Rahman turned out be a major success.

Balasubrahmanyam recorded three songs for A. R. Rahman in the latter's debut film Roja. He had a long-time association with Rahman right from Roja. Other popular songs include "July Maadham" from Pudhiya Mugam, which also marked the debut of singer Anupama, "Mannoothu Manthayilae" from Kizhakku Cheemayile which was a folk number and he almost sang all songs in the musical love story Duet and "Thanga Thaamarai" from Minsara Kanavu which fetched him, the sixth and latest of his National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer to date. 

Balasubrahmanyam's association with Hamsalekha began after the latter's successful venture Premaloka in Kannada. Balasubrahmanyam sang the most songs for Hamsalekha in Kannada. He received his fourth National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song "Umandu Ghumandu" from the Kannada film Ganayogi Panchakshari Gavayi (1995), which was a Hindustani classical music-based composition by Hamsalekha.

2000–2020

In 2013, Balasubrahmanyam recorded the title song for Chennai Express, singing for the lead actor Shah Rukh Khan, under the music direction of Vishal–Shekhar, breaking his 15-year hiatus from Hindi cinema music.

SPB is the only singer having a long spanning career of 54 years having at least two songs to record per day, even in his last days.

In May 2020, SPB crooned a song on humanity titled "Bharath Bhoomi" which was composed by Ilaiyaraaja as a tribute to the people such as police, doctors, nurses and janitors who have been significantly working amid COVID-19 pandemic. The video song was officially unveiled by Ilaiyaraaja through his official YouTube account on 30 May 2020 in both Tamil and Hindi languages. </p>

    <p>Born on 4 June 1946 in Konetammapeta, Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh, SPB grew up in a musically inclined Telugu Brahmin family. His father, S. P. Sambamurthy, was a renowned Harikatha exponent, nurturing SPB’s early musical exposure.Following his father’s wishes, he enrolled at JNTU College of Engineering in Anantapur to study Mechanical Engineering.However, a bout of typhoid forced him to abandon his engineering degree and motivated him to explore alternative paths. While his formal academic journey ended, SPB never halted his learning: he won a major singing competition in Chennai in 1964, judged by S. P. Kodandapani and Ghantasala, which transformed his pursuit from hobby to profession.Self‑taught, he mastered notation and language versatility—recording in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Hindi, Malayalam, Sanskrit, English, Urdu, and other dialects . 
       During college, he formed a light‑music troupe with Ilaiyaraaja, Anirutta, Gangai Amaran, and others, performing and honing stagecraft.Though never formally trained in classical music, he achieved mastery through self‑discipline, analytical listening, and methodical preparation—understanding lyrics deeply before performance . Balancing engineering constraints and musical inclination, he charted a unique path that melded technical rigor with creative finesse. SPB remained academically engaged by joining Chennai’s Institution of Engineers as an associate member after discontinuing studies . His education may have ended prematurely, but it shaped his inquisitive spirit that fueled lifelong learning and musical excellence.</p>
    <h1 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h1>
    <p>S. P. Balasubrahmanyam (SPB) married his distant relative Savitri in 1969 at the Simhachalam Temple in Visakhapatnam—defying initial familial objections due to sharing the same gothra. Their love story is often remembered as one of traditional yet courageous romance.Though they became a renowned couple in the public eye, SPB and Savitri chose to keep their personal world largely private. They remained devoted to family life, rooted in Telugu Brahmin culture, faith, and community ties .

From early on, SPB was deeply influenced by his mentor S. P. Kodandapani, crediting him as his guru. He even named his theater and production company after Kodandapani, carrying forward his legacy with profound respect.SPB’s humility and kindness were legendary. In a 2009 interview, a journalist shared how SPB, despite being late for an appointment, warmly invited her into his home, offered breakfast (upma!), even adjusting recipes to match her tastes, and chatted in her native Kannada—all to put her at ease .

He’d often say, “If you want to learn, you can also learn from children,” embodying not just a warm fatherly role, but also as a mentor on TV shows like Super Singer Junior, where his gentle encouragement resonated with many.SPB enjoyed everyday pleasures: he loved ice cream, smoked early on (though later quit cigarettes), and occasionally drank alcohol—openly admitting he never followed voice-restricting diets. He’d often say, “I like to eat ice creams a lot and it has never affected my voice”. Deeply spiritual, he supported charitable causes via the SP Sambamurthy Foundation—named for his father—to help the underprivileged. He was also known for sponsoring chess tournaments, including maestro Viswanathan Anand’s team in 1983.

SPB built a reputation as a conscientious board member in the Music Singers Association—attending meetings always early, offering heartfelt gratitude for contributions, and exchanging notes with senior artists. He stayed emotionally connected with fans—even those far away. In a touching gesture, upon hearing from a Sri Lankan professor who credited SPB’s songs with saving his life, SPB made a surprise visit to meet him personally.

When COVID‑19 struck in 2020, his family and fans were deeply involved in supporting him. His son, S. P. Charan, posted regular health updates on social media and thanked fans for their prayers, saying “SPB belongs to everyone.” Even in the ICU, SPB calmly assured people, “I am fine,” keeping everyone hopeful .</p>

    <p>S. P. Balasubrahmanyam and Savitri had two children who carry forward his legacy. Their daughter, Pallavi, inherited his passion for singing, making her presence known through performances and independent releases.Their son, S. P. Charan, pursued playback singing and became an actor and film producer in Telugu and Tamil film industries.  SPB often expressed that he learned as much from his children as they did from him, highlighting a bond of mutual respect . During his illness in 2020, Charan openly shared health updates on social media, thanking fans and reinforcing SPB’s connection with the public . The family remained united throughout his health crisis; both children were present by his side, managing public communications with grace . Following his passing, Charan’s heartfelt words—“SPB belongs to everyone”—reaffirmed his father’s universal appeal and humility. Pallavi and Charan continue to honor his memory through music, maintaining the family’s tradition of spreading joy through song.S. P. Balasubrahmanyam had two children—S. P. Charan, a well-known figure in the South Indian entertainment industry, and Pallavi Balasubrahmanyam, who has maintained a lower profile but shares her father’s musical talent. Charan, born in 1972, followed in his father's footsteps and became a playback singer, actor, and producer. Educated in the U.S. with a degree in Business Administration from Pace University, he returned to India to pursue a career in music and film. His singing credits include several hit Telugu and Tamil songs, and he gained recognition for producing successful films like Chennai 600028 and Aaranya Kaandam—the latter winning a National Film Award. Besides being a respected producer, Charan has also acted in films and participated in television music shows, including serving as a judge. He has been candid about living under the shadow of his legendary father, but over the years, carved his own space in the industry. His personal life included a first marriage that ended in divorce and a second marriage to Aparna in 2012. During SPB’s illness in 2020, Charan became the face of the family, regularly updating the public on his father’s condition and showing grace under pressure. Pallavi, on the other hand, has largely stayed out of the limelight. Though not actively involved in the mainstream film industry, she has displayed her musical skills through occasional classical and devotional performances. She is known to be deeply spiritual and prefers a quiet life away from public attention. Both children were extremely close to their father, and after his death, they have continued to honor his legacy—Charan more publicly through tributes, music, and managing his father’s unreleased works, while Pallavi does so quietly through personal remembrance. Together, they represent two sides of their father’s legacy: one outward-facing and influential in the entertainment world, and the other more introspective and spiritually grounded.
